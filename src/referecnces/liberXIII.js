            <p>51. Let not the failure and the pain turn aside the worshippers. The foundations of the
            pyramid were hewn in the living rock ere sunset; did the king weep at dawn that the crown
            of the pyramid was yet unquarried in the distant land?
            <br />
            52. There was also an humming-bird that spake unto the horned cerastes, and prayed him
            for poison. And the great snake of Khem the Holy One, the royal Ur&aelig;us serpent, answered
            him and said:
            <br />
            53. I sailed over the sky of Nu in the car called Millions-of-Years, and I saw not any
            creature upon Seb that was equal to me. The venom of my fang is the inheritance of my
            father, and of my father&apos;s father; and how shall I give it unto thee? Live thou and thy
            children as I and my fathers have lived, even unto an hundred millions of generations, and
            it may be that the mercy of the Mighty Ones may bestow upon thy children a drop of the
            poison of eld.
            <br />
            54. Then the humming-bird was afflicted in his spirit, and he flew unto the flowers,
            and it was as if naught had been spoken between them. Yet in a little while a serpent
            struck him that he died.
            <br />
            55. But an Ibis that meditated upon the bank of Nile the beautiful god listened and
            heard. And he laid aside his Ibis ways, and became as a serpent, saying Peradventure in an
            hundred millions of millions of generations of my children, they shall attain to a drop of
            the poison of the fang of the Exalted One.
            <br />
            56. And behold! ere the moon waxed thrice he became an Ur&aelig;us serpent, and the poison
            of the fang was established in him and his seed even for ever and for ever.</p>

        <p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>This is in truth the sole task; the others are useful
            only as adjuvants to and preparations for the One Work.</em></p>

            <p><em>Moreover, once this task has been accomplished, there is no more need of human help or
            instruction; for by this alone may the highest attainment be reached.</em></p>

            <p><em>All these grades are indeed but convenient landmarks, not necessarily significant. A
            person who had attained them all might be immeasurably the inferior of one who had
            attained none of them; it is Spiritual Experience alone that counts in Result; the rest is
            but Method.</em></p>
